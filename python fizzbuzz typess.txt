3.For numbers 1 to 100, print "Prime" if the number is prime, else print the number.

4.Print numbers from 1 to 100, but skip numbers divisible by 7.

5.From 1 to 50, print "Boom" for numbers ending with 3 (like 3, 13, 23, etc.), otherwise print the number.

6.Print numbers 1–30, but if the number is divisible by 3, print the number of asterisks * equal to the number (e.g., 6 => "******"), else print the number.

7.Replace every number divisible by 2 with "Two" and every number divisible by 5 with "Five" in a list of numbers from 1 to 50.

9.Print "Leap" for years from 1990 to 2020 that are leap years.

10. Print "Binary" if the number has only 1s and 0s in its digits, otherwise print the number. Check for numbers 1 to 100.

11.Print the sum of digits of all numbers from 1 to 20.

12.For numbers 1 to 100, print "Palin" if the number is a palindrome (e.g., 11, 22, 121), else print the number.

13.Count how many times the digit 3 appears from 1 to 100 (e.g., 3, 13, 23…).

14.Print numbers from 1 to 50. For numbers divisible by 2 and 9, print "TwoNine", otherwise print the number.
