Variable Declaration (1–8)

1. Declare an integer variable named `age` and assign your age to it.
2. Create a float variable called `height` and assign a value of 5.9 to it.
3. Assign the value `"Python"` to a variable named `language`.
4. Create a boolean variable `is_active` and set it to `True`.
5. Declare two variables `x = 10` and `y = 20`, then print their sum.
6. What is the output of this code?
   x = 5
   x = "Hello"
   print(x)
7. Create a variable named `message`, assign a value, then change its value to something else and print it.
8. Assign your name and age to variables `name` and `age`. Then print them.

String Concatenation (9–16)

9. Concatenate `"Hello"` and `"World"` and store the result in a variable called `greeting`.
10. Combine a first name and last name stored in two variables and print the full name.
11. Use the `+` operator to join `"Age: "` and the string version of an integer `25`.
12. What is the output of this?
    a = "Hello"
    b = 123
    print(a + str(b))
13. Use f-strings to create a message like: `"Hi, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."`
14. Concatenate three strings with spaces in between: `"Python"`, `"is"`, `"fun"`.
15. Fix the error in this code:
    name = "Bob"
    age = 25
    print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.")
16. Create a variable `sentence` using string concatenation to say `"The price is 100 dollars"` where 100 is stored in a separate variable.

Type Conversion (17–23)

17. Convert the string `"123"` to an integer and store it in a variable.
18. Convert the float `3.14` to a string and print its type.
19. Ask the user to input a number, then convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
20. Convert the integer `10` to a float, then print the result.
21. What is the result of `int("10.5")`? Explain why it gives an error or not.
22. Convert the string `"True"` to a boolean using `bool()` and print the result.
23. Write a program that asks for two numbers as input strings and prints their sum (after converting them to integers).

If-Else Conditionals (24–30)

24. Write a program that checks if a number is positive or negative.
25. Check if a number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
26. Ask the user to enter their age. If age is 18 or more, print `"You are an adult."`, else print `"You are a minor."`
27. Write a program to compare two numbers and print which one is larger.
28. Write an if-else to check if a variable `grade` is greater than or equal to 90. If so, print `"A"`, otherwise `"Not A"`.
29. Ask for a password input. If it matches `"admin123"`, print `"Access granted"`, else `"Access denied"`.
30. Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
